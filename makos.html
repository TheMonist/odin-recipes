        <p>Dous Makos is a type of Haitian fudge that includes layers of vanilla and chocolate in it. In 1939, a man by the name of Fernand Macos created Haitian fudge for the first time. He is considered to be the “Milton S. Hershey” of Haiti.</p>

                <li>1/2 Cup of Whole Milk</li>
                <li>1(14 oz.) Can of Sweetend Condensed Milk</li>
                <li>8 tbsp of Butter</li>
                <li>1 tsp of Vanilla Extract</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp of Anise Star Extract</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp of Nutmeg</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp of Cinnamon</li>
                <li>Red Food Coloring (Optional red layer)</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp of Cocoa Powder (Optional Dark Brown Layer)</li>
                <li>Wax Paper</li>
                <li>Mini Loaf Pans</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Grab a cooking pot with a non-stick formula on the surface of it. Add every ingredient mentioned above except for the cocoa powder and red food coloring. Put the pot on the stove and set the temperature to medium high. Let everything cook as you continue to stir the ingredients around and mix them together. Keep doing this until the sugar dissolves completely.</li>
                <li>Increase the heat on the stove to high. Stir the ingredients around for the next 20 to 25 minutes. You’ll want the mixture to have a lava consistency to it. You should also test the temperature of the mixture by placing a candy thermometer into it. If the temperature is about 115°C, then you are good to go.</li>
                <li>Turn off the heat to the stove. Keep stirring the mixture for about 10 to 15 more minutes. The shininess of the mixture should start to dissipate because it is cooling down. That is a good thing. </li>
                <li>Take out some mini loaf pans. Put wax paper on the pans. Add the mixture to the wax paper. Wait until the mixture hardens onto the paper. It should take50 to 60 minutes for this to happen. </li>
                <li>The mixture is now hardened fudge. Take off the fudge from the pan. Slice the fudge into vertical strips.</li>
                <li>Put the fudge in the refrigerator to make them chilled.  Serve the cooled fudge to your guests. There should be enough fudge to serve 8 to 10 people.</li>
